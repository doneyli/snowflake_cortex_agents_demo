# Cortex Agents in Snowflake

## Overview
This repository provides a beginner-friendly demonstration of the power of Cortex Agents in Snowflake. The demo is structured as a Jupyter Notebook, guiding users through the setup of Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst Services. By combining multiple services, we then build a Cortex Agent capable of delivering accurate responses based on PDF documents and structured data stored across multiple Snowflake tables.

## What are Cortex Agents?
Cortex Agents orchestrate both structured and unstructured data sources to deliver actionable insights. They:
- **Plan tasks**, selecting the right tools to execute them.
- **Use Cortex Analyst** for structured data (generating SQL queries).
- **Use Cortex Search** for unstructured data (extracting insights from documents and text).
- **Generate responses** using LLMs based on enterprise data.

## Cortex Agents Workflow
Cortex Agents follow a structured approach to problem-solving:
1. **Planning:** Determine the best approach to answer a user query.
2. **Explore Options:** Resolve ambiguous queries by considering different interpretations.
3. **Split into Subtasks:** Decompose complex requests into manageable parts.
4. **Route Across Tools:** Select and utilize the right tools for the task.
5. **Tool Use:** Execute queries via Cortex Analyst and Cortex Search.
6. **Reflection:** Evaluate results, refine the process, and generate a final response.
7. **Monitor & Iterate:** Continuously improve the agentâ€™s performance.

## Demo Features
- **End-to-End Setup:** Step-by-step instructions to configure Cortex Search and Cortex Analyst.
- **Practical Examples:** Hands-on implementation showcasing structured and unstructured data integration.
- **Agent API Usage:** Learn how to query the Cortex Agents API using REST calls from within a Streamlit App running in Snowflake.
- **Streamlit Agent App:** Configure easily which Services your Agent should use and let the Agent figure out the right approach to answer your questions.

## Example Questions
### Selected Services:
Make sure to select the following services:  
- **ANNUAL_REPORTS_SEARCH**
- **semantic_models/sales_orders.yaml**

### **Questions for Structured Data**
These queries operate on structured, tabular data sources.

| Question | Data Complexity | Level |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| What was the total order quantity per month with status shipped? | Single table, no Search Integration | ðŸŸ¢ **Easy** |
| What was the total order quantity per month for United Kingdom with status shipped? | Single table, 1 Search Integration | ðŸŸ¡ **Medium** |
| What was the order revenue per month for steel for my customer Delta? | 3 tables, 2 Search Integrations | ðŸ”´ **Hard** |

### **Questions for Unstructured Data**  
These queries analyze text-based documents.

| Question | Data Complexity | Level |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| What were the latest AI innovations from Googol in 2024? | Single text chunk | ðŸŸ¢ **Easy** |
| What was the net profit for Delta in 2024 and which people were part of the board? | Two chunks from one document | ðŸŸ¡ **Medium** |
| What was the combined net profit for Googol and Delta in 2024 according to their annual reports? | Two chunks from two documents | ðŸ”´ **Hard** |
